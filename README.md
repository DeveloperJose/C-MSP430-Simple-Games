## Project Description 

Impressed with your work, ACME Solutions is now
requesting your help once again. A warehouse employee stumbled upon a
box of MSP430 microcontroller boards while cleaning. No longer needed
by the company, ACME Solutions wishes to install programs to turn
these little boards into Christmas toys for children and donate them
to local orphanges. This is where your help is needed.

## Your Task 

Each MSP430 board is equipped with buttons, LED's, a
speaker, and an LED screen. Utilizing these features and your
knowledge of I/O, develop a program to turn the board into a toy for a
child.

## Getting Started 

Inside the box, several demo programs were found
alongside the MSP430 boards. ACME Solutions has provided these to you
to aid with the development of your toy. Inside your repository you
will find two directories. The "demos" directory contains the demo
programs that were found and the "project" directory is where you will
write the source code for your toy.
