msp430 interrupts demo

# Description

This demo code demonstrates timer interrupts and button interrupts
working in the same program. There are state variables to keep track
of the current states of the LEDs. The red LED flashes every 0.25
seconds and is driven by using a timer interupt. The green LED turns
on when the button is held down and turns off when the button is up.
